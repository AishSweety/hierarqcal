    "In this tutorial, we utilized HierarQcal to create and execute sorting networks including insertion, bubble and bitonic sort. With bitonic sort, we also learnt how to use nested `Qcycle` primitive from HierarQcal. We also covered sorting an unsorted sequence using bitonic sort by first creating a bitonic sequence and then using the $\\oplus$ BM[n]."
